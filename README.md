## What the hell is this?

A fun little way to turn your terminal emulator into a note taking app! Simply type in a thought, hit enter, and it will be saved to a markdown file.

## TODO

- [ ] Change where the file is saved
- [ ] Add syncing the files to an external source
- [ ] Make it more TUI like, with a nice display section etc
